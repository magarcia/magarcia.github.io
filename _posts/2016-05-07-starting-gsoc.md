title: First Weeks at GSoC 2016
---

This year I have been selected in Google Summer of Code Program. This year too I
made my first proposal. I was looking for a project related with Angular,
specially with Angular 2, to improve my knowledge about this framework and his
new version. It was amazing when I found
[this idea](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/16) from the people of
openSuse.

The community bonding period began April 22, I got in touch with my mentors
and start fixing some bugs in [Jangouts](https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Amagarcia+created%3A%3C2016-05-07_)
and reporting someones to [Janus-Gateway](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+is%3Aissue+author%3Amagarcia+created%3A%3C2016-05-07).
I hope that write this posts will be useful, for me and my mentors, to keep
a progress journal about what I'm doing about the project.

This weeks was about exploring the code of Jangouts and I try to do something with
Angular 2, and obiously to get updated about what happens in
[ng-conf](http://www.ng-conf.org).
