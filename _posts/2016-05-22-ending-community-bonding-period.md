title: Ending Community Bonding Period

It's been a few weeks since my last post, but I've been kind of busy.

Tomorrow starts the period of coding for the Google Summer of Code. So, as I
said previously, I've been working on Jangouts (making some contributions,
fixing some bugs, etc.). But also, last week I started making some tests. Not a
complete test suite, just tests for some components; the code will change a lot
with the migration to Angular 2, make a full test suite would be an useless
extra work. These tests are for learn how the code of Jangouts is structured
and know how it works.

Inside the community bonding period, I kept in touch with my mentors
(**[@imobach](https://github.com/imobach)** and **[@ancorgs](https://github.com/ancorgs)**).
This past week we had a Jangouts call (obiously we use Jangouts for meetings) to
make the planning for next weeks. We will have a Trello board to keep tasks
organized and daily meetings for follow the progress. Also, by my part, I
compromised about write a blog post each week with a brief overview about the
work of the week.

The next days the migration process to Angular 2 will start, but first I need a
planning.
