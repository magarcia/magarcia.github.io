So, as I\nsaid previously, I've been working on Jangouts (making some contributions,\nfixing some bugs, etc.). But also, last week I started making some tests. Not a\ncomplete test suite, just tests for some components; the code will change a lot\nwith the migration to Angular 2, make a full test suite would be an useless\nextra work. These tests are for learn how the code of Jangouts is structured\nand know how it works.\n\nInside the community bonding period, I kept in touch with my mentors\n(**[@imobach](https://github.com/imobach)** and **[@ancorgs](https://github.com/ancorgs)**).\nThis past week we had a Jangouts call (obiously we use Jangouts for meetings) to\nmake the planning for next weeks. We will have a Trello board to keep tasks\norganized and daily meetings for follow the progress. Also, by my part, I\ncompromised about write a blog post each week with a brief overview about the\nwork of the week.\n\nThe next days the migration process to Angular 2 will start, but first I need a\nplanning.\n"
