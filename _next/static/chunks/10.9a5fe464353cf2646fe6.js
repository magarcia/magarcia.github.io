This year too I\nmade my first proposal. I was looking for a project related with Angular,\nspecially with Angular 2, to improve my knowledge about this framework and his\nnew version. It was amazing when I found\n[this idea](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/16) from the people of\nopenSuse.\n\nThe community bonding period began April 22, I got in touch with my mentors\nand start fixing some bugs in [Jangouts](https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Amagarcia+created%3A%3C2016-05-07_)\nand reporting someones to [Janus-Gateway](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+is%3Aissue+author%3Amagarcia+created%3A%3C2016-05-07).\nI hope that write this posts will be useful, for me and my mentors, to keep\na progress journal about what I'm doing about the project.\n\nThese weeks was about exploring the code of Jangouts and I try to do something with\nAngular 2, and obiously to get updated about what happens in\n[ng-conf](http://www.ng-conf.org).\n"}}]);
