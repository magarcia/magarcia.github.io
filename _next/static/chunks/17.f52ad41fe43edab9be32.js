The following gist is an extract of the code\nI'm talking about:\n\n`gist:https://gist.github.com/magarcia/0a299cc1d352ad7e42a46d72817bc035.js?file=jh-feed.directive.js`\n\nAs you can see in the snippet, if the condition is true then the directive\nlistens for events of type `muted.byRequest`, `muted.byUser` and `muted.Join`.\nThe code that involves this events is easy, without any type of complexity (for\nnow we ignore the `$watch`).\n\nBut, wait a minute, I have read the documentation of Angular 2 like hundred\ntimes and I do not remember nothing about \"events\" with Angular 1.X style. Thats\nbecause it not exist. Angular 2 don't have a way to make events like in Angular 1,\nso I have to find a solution. After search for a solution I found [this entry](http://blog.lacolaco.net/post/event-broadcasting-in-angular-2/)\nin laco's blog.\n\n## Broadcaster\n\nBasicaly the idea is to make a service that implements the `$broadcast` and\n`$on` method like we had in `$rootScope`. For do this we use Observables, very\nimportant in Angular 2, and in this case we use a [Subject](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/subjects.md).\n\n`gist:https://gist.github.com/magarcia/0a299cc1d352ad7e42a46d72817bc035.js?file=broadcaster.ts`\n\nSo, now we can start to use events like in the example:\n\n`gist:https://gist.github.com/magarcia/0a299cc1d352ad7e42a46d72817bc035.js?file=example.component.ts`\n\n## How I solved the problem?\n\nI didn't. This events are only to show the user information pop ups about when\nhe is muted, so it's not a critical feature. By now this events are fired and\nlisten in different components, and some of it still implemented in Angular 1.4.\n\nThis is a solution I want to share with you, but I'm not sure if this will be\nthe way that I will use to solve the problem. Because this events probably won't\nbe necessary when I reimplement the `MuteNotifier`.\n"}}]);
