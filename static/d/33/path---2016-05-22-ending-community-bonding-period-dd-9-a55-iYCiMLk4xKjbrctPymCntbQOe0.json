So, as I\nsaid previously, I’ve been working on Jangouts (making some contributions,\nfixing some bugs, etc.). But also, last week I started making some tests. Not a\ncomplete test suite, just tests for some components; the code will change a lot\nwith the migration to Angular 2, make a full test suite would be a useless\nextra work. These tests are to learn how the code of Jangouts is structured\nand know how it works.</p>\n<p>Inside the community bonding period, I kept in touch with my mentors\n(<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/imobach\">@imobach</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ancorgs\">@ancorgs</a></strong>).\nThis past week we had a Jangouts call (obviously we use Jangouts for meetings) to\nmake the planning for next weeks. We will have a Trello board to keep tasks\norganized and daily meetings to follow the progress. Also, by my part, I\ncompromised to write a blog post each week with a brief overview of the\nwork of the week.</p>\n<p>The next days the migration process to Angular 2 will start, but first I need a\na plan.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Ending Community Bonding Period","date":"May 22, 2016","dateRaw":"2016-05-22","spoiler":null},"fields":{"slug":"/ending-community-bonding-period/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ending-community-bonding-period/","date":"2016-05-22","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/starting-gsoc/","directoryName":"starting-gsoc"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Weeks at GSoC 2016","date":"2016-05-07"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/first-coding-week/","directoryName":"first-coding-week"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First coding week","date":"2016-05-29"}}}}
